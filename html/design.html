            <p>let used in line 120 , 222, 230 in apply.js in the for loop because let is used for a block scope so it
                will be valid only inside the loop thats why it is used here. </p>
            <p>let used in line 267 in apply.js for the rows as it is used for a block scope and is of no use outside the function.</p>
            <p>let used in line 288 and 289 in apply.js for date and time respectively as it is used for the block scope
                inside the function updateTable as this variable has no use outside the function.</p>
            <p>let used in line 7 in program.js as it is used for a block scope since it is not required outside the
                function.</p>
            <p>let used in line 24 in program.js as it is used for the block scope and can be reassigned within the
                scope.</p>
            <h4>Usage of ES6 Features: const</h4>
            <p>const used in line 2 in program.js for the array as it is used for the block scope as well as there is no
                need of reassigning the array. Therefore const is used so that array is not changed.</p>
            <h4>Usage of ES6 Features: set</h4>
            <p>set used in line 66 and 67 in apply.js to store the chosen ranks and majors as set method will remove duplicates and then it will be effective.</p>
